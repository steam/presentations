# At Ello we feel strongly about living our values

---

# Openness & Transparency

^ From the very beginning, one of Elloâ€™s guiding principles has been openness: we strive to maintain a spirit of transparency throughout everything we do.

^ Its in our best interest to show our users how we build our software.

---

# Trust

^ Working in the open lets people independently verify that our actions and words are aligned

---

# Makes us better engineers

^ Having peers inside and outside the company review our code helps us grow as developers and as communicators

---

# Fun

^ Collaboration and involvement with the broader community gives greater significance to the work.

---

# Feels good

^ Having work seen by a larger group, potentially used by a larger group and discussed by a larger group feels good.

---

# Fosters community

^ Ello is a community of creators sharing their work with the world.

^ We build our product with the same sense of greater community.

---

# Helping others

^ Ello is an idealistic company. We've staked our brand on an ideal and ethic of doing things differently. The experiences and hard work of many individuals outside of Ello have made Ello possible. We're excited to give back through open source. We hope others can learn from our experiences just like we have learned from others.

---

# Being a good citizen

^ We rely heavily on other's open-source projects. We're able to do so many things that we wouldn't be able to do without the help of the greater open-source community. We feel its critical to give back.

^ They have written a ton about how they transformed the front end and mobile teams to be open source by default.

---

# http://artsy.github.io

^ Great posts about how they moved towards Open-Source by Default

---

# Taking the plunge

^ From the very beginning we'd imagined Ello Open-Sourcing as much of our code as possible.

^ Artsy's extensive blogging and trail of open-source projects were very helpful in giving us a blueprint for our own process.

^ Jay, Colin and I had a great discussion with Orta and Ash at Artsy about challenges and strategies for making OSS by Default a reality.

^ A major theme of their work was the internal discussions that needed to take place internally. This part of the process was surprisingly easy at Ello. Our focus on positivity and openness makes Open-Source a natural fit for us.

---

# 2 categories of code

---

# library & infrastructure code
# custom built applications

^ Library & infrastruction code is code that is more generic and reusable and more likely to develop a community and have active contributions.

^ Custom build applications - code that less about being plug and play for others and more about transparency, trust and educational opportunities.

---

# 26 public repos and counting

^ Ello has a service oriented architecture which means Ello has LOTS of applications.

# all work, both internal _**and**_ external happens in the public github repos

^ We do not work on a private copy of the repository and push code to the public repository. We work directly on the public repository.

^ When making a previously private repository public we leave as much of the git history intact as possible (commits, pull requests, discussion).

^ All new projects are started as public unless there is a good reason for them to be private.

---

# What about mixed<br>private/public code?

^ There are portions of our projects that we CANT open-source. We're legally obligated not to.

^ Our fonts, our SSL certificates used for SSL pinning, etc. In our iOS app for example. For these cases we make sure an open-source alternative works seemlessly. Default system fonts when a non-ello staff developer builds the app.

# BFG

^ we remove sensitive data in a once private repository by using BFG

^ BFG is a handy command line java application that does some git git-filter-branch magic to cleanup and re-write git history

# Open-Source by Default

1. What is Open-Source Software?
1. Why we're open-source and why you should be too
1. How we do it
1. **How to convince your company**

---

# **How do you sell this to your boss/investor/co-founder/co-worker?**

---

# 1. Improve Team Culture

^ Open-Source improves team culture by empowering engineers to contribute to both the company and greater developer community.

---

# 2. Attract Talent

^ Having your company's code available for everyone to see is a powerful advertisement for the kind of company you are. Other developers and companies will notice.

---

# 3. Press and Attention

^ Our Ello-iOS project has over 500 stars and has generated interest in Ello through several articles and on network interest. The tech world and our users love that our iOS is open-source.

---

# 4. Best practices

^ Having the team work in the open enforces that everyone on the team is following the best practices/engineering processes. There is nothing like having the team's work in full view to motivate folks to produce their best work.

---

# 5. Improve Communication

^ Working in the open requires better communication. Members of the team will, be necessity, begin to communicate more clearly and thoroughly when their audience is larger than the person sitting next to them.

---

# Don't give it **all** away

^ At Ello, the value of our network is the thriving community of creators sharing their work and ideas with others. The database containing the creator's work and interactions is our core business value, not the building blocks of technology.

^ Keep the truly proprietary stuff closed source. Focus on protecting the things that should protected and open-source the rest.

---

# **How do you change the culture of your engineering team?**

---

# Start contributing to the projects you already use

^ This goes back to being a good citizen of our open-source world. If you end up fixing something in an open-source project you use. Submit a pull request. If you add features or extend an existing open-source project, make sure you submit a pull request.

---

# Start small

^ Pick a an internal project and make the repo public

---

# The code doesn't have to be<br>perfect on day one

^ If you strive to be a good engineer, you're doing better than most. We're very proud of products, and our code. Well, most of it. Sure we'd like some of it to be better. But just like the rest of you we are making products for actual people to use, with actual deadlines and competing priorities. I promise you that your code will not be the first code in the wild in need of a bit of love. Head to github.com/ello if you want to see some great code, as well as some "needs improving" code.

# Challenges/Concerns

---

# [fit] ![inline](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CTTlZtlWIAEjgg9.jpg)

---

# Trolls & Churn

^ When we first open-sourced the iOS app we had concerns about the amount of time and energy it would take to handle the trolls and unconstructive pull requests. This has largely turned out to be a non-issue.

^ The activity we get on the github project is positive and helpful. We've had strangers submit pull request and ask great questions. Just the other day a user posted an issue asking about the architecture of a piece of our networking layer. To our amazement another non-ello staff member answered, correctly! We were pretty stoked.

---

# Motivation and consistency

^ Enthusiasm for adhering to an OSS by Default approach goes up and down. Having consistent processes in place help keep the team on track.

^ Little steps and a continued focus are the best way to get there. It won't happen over night. We've got a long way to go.

---

![inline](http://downloadwallpaperhd.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Memes-Challenge-Accepted-Wallpaper-HD.jpg)

---

# Next Steps

---

# Making the apps easy to install and bootstrap

^ Our API is not open-source, this poses big problems for folks wanting to build our apps. At the moment, no one outside of Ello can connect to a staging or production environment to load data.

---

# Open-Source outside of Engineering

^ Our goal is to move more of our operations out from behind the curtain. Our WTF section is an example of this. We'd like to move further in this direction.

^ Our culture and processes are great candidates for open-source.

Guidelines/rules
Ello was created by idealists who believe that the essential nature of all human beings is to be kind, considerate, helpful, intelligent, responsible, and respectful of others, and we want to carry that spirit with us into the open source realm. To that end, we will be enforcing the Ello rules within all of our open source projects. If you donâ€™t follow the rules, you risk being ignored, banned, or reported for abuse.

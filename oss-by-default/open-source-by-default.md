# At Ello we feel strongly about living our values

---

# Openness & Transparency

^ From the very beginning, one of Ello’s guiding principles has been openness: we strive to maintain a spirit of transparency throughout everything we do.
^ Its in our best interest to show our users how we build our software.

---

# Trust

^ Working in the open lets people independently verify that our actions and words are aligned

---

# Makes us better engineers

^ Having peers inside and outside the company review our code helps us grow as developers and as communicators

---

# Fun

^ Collaboration and involvement with the broader community gives greater significance to the work.

---

# Feels good

^ Having work seen by a larger group, potentially used by a larger group and discussed by a larger group feels good.

---

# Fosters community

^ Ello is a community of creators sharing their work with the world.
^ We build our product with the same sense of greater community.

---

# Helping others

^ Ello is an idealistic company. We've staked our brand on an ideal and ethic of doing things differently. The experiences and hard work of many individuals outside of Ello have made Ello possible. We're excited to give back through open source. We hope others can learn from our experiences just like we have learned from others.

---

# Being a good citizen

^ We rely so heavily on other's open-source projects. We're able to do so many things that we wouldn't be able to do without the help of the greater open-source community. We feel its critical to give back.

---

# [fit] :clap: :clap: :clap:

# Now, why should _**you**_ be<br>Open-Source by Default

# All of the above, _**Obviously**_

# Recruiting

^ Turns out folks love working on Open-Source

# Security

# Access to tools

^ There is nothing like having all your code on display to world to keep you honest and working your hardest to have well written and well factored code.

# **How we do it**

^ things that are more generic and reusable more likely to develop community and have active contributions

^ less about being plug and play for others more about transparency, educational opportunities

# **How do you sell this to your boss/investor/co-founder/co-worker?**

---

# 1. Improve team culture

---

# 2. Attract talent

---

# 3. Press and Attention

---

Two big pieces:
1. How do you sell this to your boss/investors/co-founders/co-workers
Team culture, Recruiting, press and attention

Don't give away the keys to the castle

Your value in the company is more about the running system than the legos used to build the system.

Focus on protecting the things that should protected and open-source the rest.

Review the chat with Orta/Ash for examples.

2. How do you change the culture of your engineering team?

Start by having the team contribute back to the open-source projects important to your organization. Be a good citizen.

Having the team work in the open enforces that everyone on the team is following the best practices/engineering processes

Doesn't have to be perfect day one.

Guidelines/rules
Ello was created by idealists who believe that the essential nature of all human beings is to be kind, considerate, helpful, intelligent, responsible, and respectful of others, and we want to carry that spirit with us into the open source realm. To that end, we will be enforcing the Ello rules within all of our open source projects. If you don’t follow the rules, you risk being ignored, banned, or reported for abuse.
